Still not possible to easily tell 'when clicked on a-entity' on a-frame 0.9.0:
3 possibilities:

- ray intersection (on a scene), using rayintersect prop: difficult to calculate intersection.
    Intesrected object outputted on event is not reliable. Miss a lot of clicks
- do something when clicked on all a-scene and check for visible markers (marker.object3D.visible). ok if click has not to be
    over 3D model and if app has to manage only one marker at time
- add ray origin intersection on specific marker element: not reliable (my old method)
